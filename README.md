# Intro
This is Learning Platform v2, an educational learning platform for the CUHK Managerial Economics course.
The Repository is bootstraped with Create React App, please refer to [link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to learn how to start the application. 
The project aims to enhance students' learning experience and encourage interactions between teacher & students and also among students with pre-class teaching videos and in-class activities. One key quality of business students is being able to build different strategies corresponding to different markets and competitions. The pre-class videos developed by our project demonstrate the associated economic theories, and the in-class interactive game - the Business Competition Simulation (BCS) game engages students and encourages them to apply the knowledge and insights gained from the theories.
The learning platform contains two interfaces: 
  1. The first interface is for teachers to configure the platform and monitor students' activites by logging decision making time and data visualization.
  2. the other one provides data visulization for current market and basic information for students to make decision.
